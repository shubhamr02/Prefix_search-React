# Getting started with the database

The product is a database which contains the items such as computer accessories products.

Use Case:
User can search for product in input field.
When the user enters the name it performs prefix-search on the column such as title and description.
The row is filtered based on user input. It returns the row if the product found or an empty row if they are null.
On Clicking on row the page is redirected to a static page with the help of react-router.

Following schema of db in json format. This is low db data and it is exposed to the REST API.

### `{ products: ["products" : [{ "id" : 1, "name": "mouse", "description": "Wired mouse with mousepad", "price" : 299, "left" : "In stock" },

### ] }`

## Start db server

Go to db folder using cd command.

### `cd db`

Run the below command. This will start json server at the port 3000

### `npx json-server --watch product.js`

# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs all the dependencies automatically bundled in the project.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
